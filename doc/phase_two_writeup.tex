\section{Running the program}
The program is fully dockerized and can be run using the following commands:
\begin{center}
  docker pull gespatcho/cpsc371\_ai:latest\\
  docker run -a stdin -a stdout -i -t gespatcho/cpsc371\_ai
  
\end{center}
\section{Results}
As of the time of writing this I do not have stochastic back-propagation working so I have nothing to report as the success of training the
neural net.

If you want to at least load up a NN with the right size for the xor problem you can load the file named xornn.csv

\section{Classes / Data Structures / Algorithms}
\subsection{SBP\_Impl}
Provides the stochastic back propagation function an interface with the following functionality:
\begin{itemize}
\item get and set the weights on edges
\item check how many layers there are and how big they are
\item feed an input vector forward and return the result vector
\item get the net values resulting from the last feed-forward
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Neural\_Net}
Implements SBP\_Impl

\subsection{neural\_net\_sbp}
Takes a SBP\_Impl object along with a list of input/expected output pairs and trains the net on that data.
